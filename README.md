# Dataset Used
The dataset encompasses agricultural data for multiple crops cultivated across various states in India from the year 1997 till 2020. The dataset provides crucial features related to crop yield prediction, including crop types, crop years, cropping seasons, states, areas under cultivation, production quantities, annual rainfall, fertilizer usage, pesticide usage, and calculated yields.
